## Software Developer

I like everything related to computers. I've started many projects; however, I haven't finished them all!

The first project I uploaded to GitHub was **Spooky-1.0.0**, a simple Minecraft mod that adds ambiance and scary sounds in caves.

I am developing other projects like PYSH. An SDK dedicated to the LliureX OS. It is a very simple open-source "program" that helps you develop desktop applications very easily. Feel free to try the SDK on other Linux distributions.If you do, please open an issue ticket and let me know what you found out!

Right now, I'm focused on learning C++. I've already programmed some tools, but my goal is to reach a level where I no longer need to use ChatGPT.
