## Software Developer

I like everything related to computers. I've started many projects; however, I haven't finished them all!

The first project I uploaded to GitHub was **Spooky-1.0.0**, a simple Minecraft mod that adds ambiance and scary sounds in caves.

Right now, I'm focused on learning C++. I've already programmed some tools, but my goal is to reach a level where I no longer need to use ChatGPT.
